    <h2>About the Game</h2>
    <p>Cards For Cowboys is a deck-building card game where luck meets strategy in the Wild West. Push your luck by drawing cards, but watch out for Bandits -- draw three and you bust! Spend your coins to buy powerful new cards from the solitaire-style store, grow your herd of Cows, and outscore your rivals across three thrilling Acts.</p>

    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <div class="steps">
      <div class="step">
        <h3>1. Draw Phase</h3>
        <p>All players draw cards from their personal deck one at a time. Stop whenever you want -- but if you flip three Bandits, you bust and lose your turn!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h3>2. Buy Phase</h3>
        <p>Spend the coins you drew to buy a card from the solitaire store, adding it to your deck. Or burn a card to reveal what's hidden underneath.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step">
        <h3>3. Score Cows</h3>
        <p>If you didn't bust, add any Cows you drew this round to your Herd. The player with the most Cows after all three Acts wins!</p>
