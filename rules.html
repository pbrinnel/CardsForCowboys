    <!-- SETUP -->
    <section>
      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Each player begins with a personal 10-card starter deck.</li>
        <li>For a <strong>2-player</strong> game, put away all cards marked "3+P" or "4+P".</li>
        <li>For a <strong>3-player</strong> game, put away all cards marked "4+P".</li>
        <li>For each Act, build a face-down solitaire pyramid with all cards for that Act (see the cowboy hat number at bottom-right = Act 1/2/3).</li>
        <li>The top row has 1 card, and each row below adds one more:
          <ul>
            <li>5 rows for 2 players</li>
            <li>6 rows for 3 players</li>
            <li>7 rows for 4 players</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Flip the bottom row of cards face-up.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- DRAW PHASE -->
    <section>
      <h2>Sequence of Play</h2>

      <h3>1. Draw Phase</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>All players draw cards from the top of their personal deck, one at a time. (Players may draw simultaneously.)</li>
        <li>Players may stop drawing at any time.</li>
        <li>If a player draws <strong>3 or more Bandits</strong>, they <strong>bust</strong> immediately &mdash; their turn is over and all drawn cards go to the discard pile.</li>
        <li>When your draw pile is empty, shuffle your discard pile to form a new draw pile. Cut one card from top to bottom after shuffling.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- BUY PHASE -->
    <section>
      <h3>2. Buy Phase</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Players who did not bust add any Cows they drew this round to their Herd.</li>
        <li>Each non-busted player may <strong>buy one card</strong> from the Store using the total coins drawn this round. Place the purchased card and all drawn cards into your discard pile.</li>
        <li>When a card is purchased or burned, reveal any cards underneath that are no longer covered.</li>
        <li>Instead of buying, a player may <strong>burn one card</strong> &mdash; removing it from the game and revealing card(s) underneath.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Buy Order</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>The player with the most $ chooses who buys first.</li>
        <li>If tied: most Cows this round.</li>
        <li>If still tied: most drawn cards.</li>
        <li>If still tied: compare sell value of drawn cards in order.</li>
        <li>If still tied: rock-paper-scissors.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Buying proceeds clockwise from the first player.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Once all eligible players have bought/passed, discard all drawn cards and begin a new round.</li>
        <li>When the last card is bought or burned from the Store, the round ends immediately. All non-busted players still score Cows, even if they didn't get to buy.</li>
        <li>Set up Acts 2 &amp; 3 the same way. Shuffle all discarded cards back into your draw deck.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- WINNING -->
    <section>
      <h3>3. Winning</h3>
      <p>The player with the most Cows in their Herd at the end of Act 3 wins!</p>

    <!-- ERRATA -->
    <section>
      <h2>Errata</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You may freely check the card backs in your draw pile.</li>

        <li><strong>Draw</strong> = Draw from the top of your personal deck.</li>
        <li>"Return card(s) to top of deck before buy phase" means do not use any $ or Cows from that card before returning it.</li>
        <li>"Look at top 3 cards" is done after drawing.</li>
        <li>"Trash to Jail a Bandit" cards must be used <em>before</em> busting.</li>
        <li>If you run out of cards in both your draw and discard pile, stop drawing for the round.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- STRATEGY -->
    <section>
      <h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pay attention to card back colors:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1 Cactus</strong> &mdash; generally safe (fewer or no Bandits).</li>
            <li><strong>2 Cacti</strong> &mdash; moderate risk (may contain 1 Bandit).</li>
            <li><strong>3 Cacti</strong> &mdash; high risk (may contain 1&ndash;2 Bandits).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Tracking which cards you haven't drawn gives you a big edge. Start by remembering whether you've drawn your double-Bandit card yet.</li>
        <li>Balance the risk of busting against the reward of gaining more $ and Cows.</li>
        <li>It's not always best to draw as many cards as possible. If you have enough $ for this round, consider stopping to set up a strong hand next round.</li>
      </ul>
