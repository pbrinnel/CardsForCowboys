    <h2>About the Game</h2>
    <p>Every round is a gamble. Draw cards from your deck to earn Coins and Cows -- but Bandits are lurking. Flip three and you bust, losing everything you drew. Know when to push and when to stop, because the cards you don't draw are just as important as the ones you do.</p>
    <img src="images/setup-pyramid.jpg" alt="Solitaire pyramid card store setup" class="about-img">
    <p>Between draws, spend your Coins on powerful new cards from a shared solitaire pyramid store. Every purchase reshapes your deck, shifting the odds for future rounds. Over three Acts the stakes climb, the cards get wilder, and one wrong draw can flip the whole game.</p>

      <div class="feature">
        <h3>2-4 Players</h3>
        <p>Quick to teach, plays in 20-30 minutes. A solitaire pyramid store scales the card pool to your group size.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Push Your Luck</h3>
        <p>Every card you draw could be Coins, Cows, or a Bandit. Three Bandits and you bust -- but stopping early means leaving money on the table.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Build Your Deck</h3>
        <p>Buy cards with special abilities -- Jail a Bandit, copy your next draw, peek at upcoming cards, or trash dead weight to slim your deck.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Read the Backs</h3>
        <p>Every card shows its risk on its back. One cactus means safe. Three cacti means danger -- and big rewards. Use this to count your odds before you draw.</p>
